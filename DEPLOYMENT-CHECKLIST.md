## Important URLs and Commands ðŸ”—

### Service Commands
```bash
# Start/Stop DCAM
sudo systemctl start dcam
sudo systemctl stop dcam
sudo systemctl restart dcam

# Check status
sudo systemctl status dcam
sudo journalctl -u dcam -f

# Nginx commands
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Access URLs
- **DCAM Production**: https://your-domain.com/dcam/
- **Redmine Production**: https://your-domain.com/
- **Server SSH**: ssh user@your-server

### File Locations
- **DCAM Application**: `/opt/dcam/`
- **Nginx Config**: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`
- **Service Config**: `/etc/systemd/system/dcam.service`
- **Backups**: `/opt/backups/dcam/`
- **Logs**: `journalctl -u dcam`

## Rollback Plan ðŸ”„

In case of deployment failure:

1. **Stop DCAM service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop dcam
   sudo systemctl disable dcam
   ```

2. **Remove Nginx configuration**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-site
   # Remove DCAM location blocks
   sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

3. **Restore from backup** (if needed):
   ```bash
   cd /opt/backups/dcam/
   tar -xzf dcam_config_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz
   ```

4. **Verify Redmine is working**:
   - Check https://your-domain.com/
   - Verify all Redmine functions

## Success Criteria âœ…

Deployment is considered successful when:

- [ ] DCAM is accessible via https://your-domain.com/dcam/
- [ ] Redmine continues to work normally
- [ ] User authentication functions properly
- [ ] File upload/download works
- [ ] All major features are operational
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Backup system is functional
- [ ] Monitoring is active
